Welcome to our **Multi-Modal IST (MMIST)** project! 

Our goal is to acquire, curate, and publicly release multi-modal datasets of different types of cancer to support and advance the research on personalized medicine for oncology patients.

Our compromises are:
  * Curate and release new datasets;
  * Periodically updat and improve the existing datasets;
  * Provide benchmarks for different tasks using our datasets.
